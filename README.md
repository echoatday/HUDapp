# HUDrandomizer

This currently only displays the dark souls HUD as a test.

### Complete:
- Remove window border and top bar
- Apply transparency to the background
- Make the form click-through

### To-Do:
- Add more images
- On startup, run a method to select a random image
- Create a timer that accesses the selection method
- Group images by screen location, and only allow one per group

### Bugs / Issues:
- Current transparency technique causes borders on images.
